# Model analysis project

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.

**Summary:** Our project is titled **An examination of the Cournot Model for two and multiple Firms** and as the title suggest it explores the properties of the Cournot model. We start out by examining a market with two firms, meaning a duopol and solving it both analytical and numerical. Additionally we examine the impact of varying the paramters $a$, $b$ and $c$. Finally we extend the Cournot Model to include N number of frms and analyse how it affects the quantity produced..
