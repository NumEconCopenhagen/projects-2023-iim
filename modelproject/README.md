# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cournot model for N firms** and as the title suggest it explores the properties of the Cournot model. We start out by looking at the market with two firms, meaning and duopol and solving it both analytical and numerical. Afterwards we extend the model to include N fnumber of irms and analyse how it affects the result

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
